# Permanent Terminal Buffer

> [!NOTE]
> Not adapted for public usability. Integrated into my personal setup.

Interface for defining applications that will be started in a nvim terminal buffer. Toggling switches between current nvim view and the terminal-buffer view, Terminal retains its content. The config yields a command that can be bound to a keybinding.

Use case: ALT+g brings up `Lazygit`. Pressing ALT+g again closes the terminal and returns to the previous Neovim view.
